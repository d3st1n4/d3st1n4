## Hi, I'm Destiny! 👋🏾 

An SEO Tech Developer Alumna seeking opportunities to hone my software development skills :D

💡 I'm a rising junior at Brown University studying Computer Science and International and Public Affairs. As a Jamaican-American native New Yorker, I'm fueled by my desire to forge equitable systems for diverse communities. My programming interests are __front-end engineering__, UI/UX design, and technology's intersection with society.

👩🏾‍💻 Currently working on building my portfolio website <br> 🌱 Learning more about Node.js and other web development tools <br> 💥 When I'm not coding, I enjoy weightlifting, exploring new places and crafting

Let's connect! <br><br>
